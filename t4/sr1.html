<p align="center">Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard<br>
Said no more counting dollars<br>
We'll be counting stars<br>
Yeah, we'll be counting stars<br><br>
I see this life, like a swinging vine<br>
Swing my heart across the line<br>
And in my face is flashing signs<br>
Seek it out and ye shall find<br><br>
Old, but I'm not that old<br>
Young, but I'm not that bold<br>
And I don't think the world is sold<br>
On just doing what we're told<br><br>
I feel something so right<br>
Doing the wrong thing<br>
And I feel something so wrong<br>
Doing the right thing<br>
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie<br>
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive<br><br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard<br>
Said no more counting dollars<br>
We'll be counting stars<br><br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep<br>
Dreaming about the things we could be<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard<br>
Said no more counting dollars<br>
We'll be, we'll be counting stars<br>
Yeah<br><br>
I feel your love and I feel it burn<br>
Down this river, every turn<br>
Hope is our four-letter word<br>
Make that money, watch it burn<br><br>
Old, but I'm not that old<br>
Young, but I'm not that bold<br>
And I don't think the world is sold<br>
On just doing what we're told<br><br>
And I feel something so wrong<br>
Doing the right thing<br>
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie<br>
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly<br><br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard<br>
Said no more counting dollars<br>
We'll be counting stars<br><br>

Dreaming about the things that we could be<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard<br>
Said no more counting dollars<br>
We'll be, we'll be counting stars<br><br>
Oh, take that money, watch it burn<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned<br>
Take that money, watch it burn<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned<br>
Take that money, watch it burn<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned<br>
Take that money, watch it burn<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned<br>
Everything that kills me<br>
Makes me feel alive<br><br>
